# Titanic-Dataset

# Overview
The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, their age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes.

In this analysis, we explore the dataset, preprocess the data, perform logistic regression to predict survival, and evaluate the model's performance.

# Results
After performing logistic regression, we achieved an accuracy of 78.77% on the test dataset.
